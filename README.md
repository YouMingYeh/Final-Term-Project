# Final Term Project

After half a year of Programing Design crouse at NTUIM, I eventually built this final term project with my teamates. This is a 2 players battle game, which was developed all by ourselves, with help from Youtube videos.

This project is built on macOS with Terminal and VScode. As a consequence, this game can only be run by macOS system. You need to fix some part of the code and files to adjust the executable file to your computer if your one is on Windows system. Also, this game required player to download SFML for C++ to run the game. We will put the download tutorials below. Check them out if you want! If you have all these done, just click the PLAY.exec to play this enjoyable game!

By the way, if you are lazy to download SFML on your computer and you have a mac, we put a zip file below, you can just download and run them right away.

This project is built in C++, SFML.
